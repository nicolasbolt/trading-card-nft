# Trading Card NFTs

**Note**

- This project is a test project running on Rinkeby.
- The images are not pinned, to run this you will need to pin the images in the img folder.

## What does this project do?

This project will mint a random trading card using the Chainlink VRFCoordinatorV2 to give us a random number to choose which trading card will be minted. There are 4 total choices each with their own rarity set.
